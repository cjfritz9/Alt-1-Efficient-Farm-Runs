# Efficient Farm Runs

#### Efficient Farm Runs is a light-weight Alt 1 plugin that allows you to create presets for multiple types of farm runs, create a profile for which patches and items you have access to, and provide (or remind in my case) an optimal route with the closest teleports.

#### Special thanks to:

###### QuikkFreeze

for all of the help with TypeScript and being my Sr. Developer

###### Skillbert

for creating Alt 1 and being so generous with helping other developers, providing Alt 1 minimal templates, writing hundreds if not thousands of lines of comments to explain your node packages and functions.
